context_and_goal: |
  "This is a classification task where the goal is to predict the class labels for instances in the balance-scale dataset. 
  The goal is to determine if the balance scale will tip to the left, tip to the right, or remain balanced based on the provided features.
  The features are numerical values representing distances and weights on both sides of the balance scale.
  Here are some details about the features found in the dataset:
  {
    "left-distance": "Left distance in balance scale in meters",
    "left-weight": "Left weight in balance scale in kg",
    "right-distance": "Right distance in balance scale in meters",
    "right-weight": "Right weight in balance scale in kg"
  }
